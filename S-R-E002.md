## Choosing a good SLI

#### user happiness in metric form

Happiness test: ->SLO should rep the dividing line between happy and unhappy users

#### Metrics

    system metrics

    internal state

#### Properties of a good SLI

    Has predictable relationship with user happiness

    shows services is working as users expect it

    Expressed as good events/valid events

    Aggregated over a long time horizon


#### Ways of measuring SLI

    Request Logs

    Application metrics

    Front-end infra metrics

    Synthetic clients  ---> approximation of user behavior

    Client-side instrumentation

    the user

#### SLI Menu

Request/Response

    Availability

    Latency

    Quality

Data processing

    Coverage

    correctness

    Freshness

    Throughput

Storage

    Durability

#### The SLI Equation:

    SLI = ((good events)/(valid events))

Properties of SLI:

    SLIs falls between 0 and 100%

    Consistency makes building common tooling easier

#### request/ Response SLIs

Tracking Requests

    Availability

    Latency

    Quality

### Data Processing (SLIs)

#### SLI types:

They provide:

    freshness-> Measure sys's performance against expectations & perform engineering decisions
    
    correctness->The proportion of valid data producing correct output
    
    coverage->the proportion on valid data processed successfully
    
    throughput->The proportion of time where data processing rate is faster than threshold

Batch processing system:->time since completion of the last successful process run


### Managing complex system:

#### Real complex system

Have 1-3 SLIs only for each user

Few SLIs avoids increasing the cognitive load of your ops team

N/B:

    Not all metrics makes good SLIs

    More SLIs results in cognitive load

    more SLIs lower signal to signal-to-noise ratio


#### Managing complex system with aggregation

Must implement:

    availability
