## Developing SLOs and SLIs

Steps for developing SLI:

    1. Choose the SLI Specification for the SLI menu

    2. Refine the Specification into a detailed SLI implementation

    3. walk through the user journey and look for coverage gaps
    
    4. set aspiration SLO targets based on business needs

#### Game sample study case

plans for the Game:

    Multiple game ares

    Per-area leaderboards

    50M monthly/1-10M daily players

    New areas monthly to be deployed

#### Refining SLI specification

Profile page:

    should load successfully

    should load quickly

Determined clearly by:

    Where is SLI being measured

    What does SLI measure

    What metrics should be included/excluded

    is there enough details to implement this SLI

What SLI types should we consider measuring for this journey

    Availability-->proportion of valid request that were served successfully

            --> Measure request at the load balancer (Response Codes)

    Latency---> proportion of valid request that were served faster than a given threshold



#### Failure Modes in SLIs

Added CDN to check for network failure

Questions to answer:

    Do the SLIs adequately capture the user journey and its failure modes?

    are there any expectations or edge cases to consider?

    Do the SLIs capture multiple journey with different needs?

#### Failure modes

Load balancers captures help in capturing errors

bad code pushed to produciton

Error codes 5xx and 4xx

overload failures
