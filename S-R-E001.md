## Site Reliability Engineering

#### Difference between SRE and DevOps

#### DevOps

    Reduce organizational Silos

    Accept Failure as normal

    Implement Gradual change

    Leverage tooling & Automation

    Measure everything

#### SRE

    Share ownership
    SLOs & Blameless PMs--(Postmoterms)
    canary things-(release in small percentages)
    Automations
    MEasure Toil and reliability

#### Roles of an SRE

Teach customers and users how to connect SRE to their services and servers

Communicate with customers and help the understand SRE

Helps users integrate APIs with less systems failure

CRE->Customer Reliability Engineering- >Reasposible for making sure users get to understand how services work

make sure all have visibility into the system

####  CRE Reliability principles

1. Reliability is the most important future

2. Users, not monitoring , decide reliability

3. Well-engineered (software/operation/business-99.9%)

#### Reliability in the Cloud

3-9s --> Well engineered s/w

4-9s--> 40 mins to complete and resolve the issue

5-9s-->24secs of complete down time

#### SLOs importance (Service Level Object)

makes sure services are reliable enough

provides common language and understanding around reliability

How fast is "too fast" measure on developing systems

Get the right level of reliability for the system support

must have Product/Engineering team and Operations/support engineers


#### SLOs vs SLAs(Service Level Agreements)

SLAs -> agree with customers about the reliability of your service

SLOs -> Thresholds that catch an issue before it breaches your SLA

#### The hapiness test

Reliable service-> the service need targets SLOs that capture the performance and availability levels that if
    barely met will keep a customer happy

#### Measuring Reliability

    Time to start---> Latency (SLIs) - Service Level Indicators

    Interruptions

    SLIs: good event/ Valid Events

#### edge cases

Error budget->amount of errors allowed to be served based on your SLOs


#### Targets for reliability

Cost might exceed Reliability

have ambitious but achievable targets

Measure how SLI is performing againet target

Iteration of SLOs is very important

Always have a review after certain interval of your service


### Quantifying missed Reliability

#### Error budget

This is an inverse of availability and tells us how unreliable our service is allowed to be

This is inverse of SLO

quantitative metric for service unreliability

help to balance development velocity and reliability

Error budgets align incentives between different parts of the organization

with ER Developers can self-regulate and manage risk better with error budgets.

Benefits:
    Commonn incentives for Devs and SREs

    Dev team can self-manage risk

    unrealistic goals become unattractive


### Trading off Reliability Againest Features

#### Everything is a trade-off

Lower daily pushes to s/w

Align incentives -Meet the budget

    Devs can take risks and push more quickly

    SRE teams can work more proactive

Effective SLOs: ->have executive buy-in

                -> Have consequences-too many pushes

                ->Are accurately measured (Release features only until budget is exhausted)

#### Advanced budgets

Advanced techniques:

    Dynamic releases cadence  -  (based on remaining error budget)

    "Rainy Day" Fund    -  (covers unexpected events)

    Error budget-based alerts  -  (exhaustion rate drives alerting)
    
    Silver bullets--> for unavoidable critical new features


### Making Services more Reliable

#### Axes of improvements

Reduce deployment rate

Fix bugs in a system

TDD-Time-To-Detect (Time to detect and be informed fix an issue by SRE )

TTR -Time-To-Resolution (Gap between when informed to fix and fixing the issue)

    E = ((TTR+TDD) * (impact%))/TTF

TTF- How frequent you expect a failure to occur

TBF -Time between Failure

improve Reliability:

    1. Reduce detection time (lower TTD)
    2. Reducing Repair Time (Lower TTR)
    3. Reduce impact percentage (lower users/Functionality)
    4. Reducing Frequency (increase TTF )

#### Operational approach to increasing Reliability

    Report on uneven error budget spend

    provide input on achieving target

    Have standardized Infrastructure

    Consult on system design

    Build safe release and rollback

    Author postmortems

    Use phased rollouts
    
    
    

#### Question 1
When improving service reliability, what are some ways you can improve the time-to-detect

    Add automated alerting that pages a human

    Implement monitoring for your service.

Question 2
When improving service reliability, what are some ways you can improve the time-to-resolution?


    Develop a playbook for outage scenarios

    Create automation for manual mitigation steps

What are some operational ways you can increase reliability

    Periodically collect data on poor reliability regions and focus extra efforts on those regions

    Providing post-mortems


    Work with the development team to provide input on the feasibility of achieving targets
