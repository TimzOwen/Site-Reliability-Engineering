## Site Reliability Engineering

#### Difference between SRE and DevOps

#### DevOps

    Reduce organizational Silos

    Accept Failure as normal

    Implement Gradual change

    Leverage tooling & Automation

    Measure everything

#### SRE

    Share ownership
    SLOs & Blameless PMs--(Postmoterms)
    canary things-(release in small percentages)
    Automations
    MEasure Toil and reliability

#### Roles of an SRE

Teach customers and users how to connect SRE to their services and servers

Communicate with customers and help the understand SRE

Helps users integrate APIs with less systems failure

CRE->Customer Reliability Engineering- >Reasposible for making sure users get to understand how services work

make sure all have visibility into the system

####  CRE Reliability principles

1. Reliability is the most important future

2. Users, not monitoring , decide reliability

3. Well-engineered (software/operation/business-99.9%)

#### Reliability in the Cloud

3-9s --> Well engineered s/w

4-9s--> 40 mins to complete and resolve the issue

5-9s-->24secs of complete down time

#### SLOs importance (Service Level Object)

makes sure services are reliable enough

provides common language and understanding around reliability

How fast is "too fast" measure on developing systems

Get the right level of reliability for the system support

must have Product/Engineering team and Operations/support engineers


#### SLOs vs SLAs(Service Level Agreements)

SLAs -> agree with customers about the reliability of your service

SLOs -> Thresholds that catch an issue before it breaches your SLA

#### The hapiness test

Reliable service-> the service need targets SLOs that capture the performance and availability levels that if
    barely met will keep a customer happy

#### Measuring Reliability

    Time to start---> Latency (SLIs) - Service Level Indicators

    Interruptions

    SLIs: good event/ Valid Events

#### edge cases

Error budget->amount of errors allowed to be served based on your SLOs
